# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore and demonstrate Excel capabilities such as pivot tables, charts and formulas. It is also an introduction on how to use GitHub for basic writing and formatting syntax for GitHub.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  - This is the first time utilizing/navigating GitHub and operating through the software is a new experience. The terminology and verbage is also a unknown territory and may need some time getting used to, however, the GitHub Help page was especially helpful and understanding the software.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - First conclusion that can be drawn from the analysis is that there are higher success rate in the months of May to July.
  - Second conclusion that can be drawn from the analysis is that there is a trend for both success and failure around the months of January to March and September to November.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - There is an inverse relationship between percentage success and percentage failure. As the percent success declines, there is a rise in percent failures.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - One limitation observed with this dataset is that it lacks statistical background. It requires deeper dive into the measures of central tendency, variance, and standard deviation between the success and failure campaigns to determine what worked and did not worked. Identifying outliers could also help determine if the dataset is skewed.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - Other possible tables/graphs that could be created are Descriptive Statistics table to gain insight into the goals and pledges and Box and Whiskers for visualization of the data and identifying outliers in the data.
